# How do I upload my VHD and ISO files to LOD?

Those of you building your virtual machines outside of our site will want to know how to upload your VHD (Hyper-V disk images) and ISO files so that you can use them inside of your LOD lab environment.

Once you are logged in to LOD:

1. On the **[Site Administration](https://labondemand.com/Admin)** page.
1. On the Storage tile, click **Manage Storage**. This opens up the Storage page for your organization.
1. Browse through the storage to the desired location, and click Upload File. 
  1. Microsoft Storage is for the Hyper-V platform (VHD, VHDX, ISO and VFD).
  1. VMWare Storage is for the vSphere platform (ISO only).
1. In the Upload File dialog, click **Choose Files**. 
1. In the Open dialog navigate to and select the **file(s)**, then click **Open**. This brings you back to the Upload File dialog.
1. On the Upload File dialog, click **Upload** to begin the upload of your file(s).

The time it takes to upload a file is dependent on the file size and connection speed.
